        <p>
    Hello and thank you for visiting my first webpage. Here is a some information about myself. I was born, raised and still live in San Antonio, Tx, home of the Alamo and San Antonio Spurs (Favorite Team). I am a total noob (lol) in the coding industry but with the support of my wife and tutelage from my best friend, I will accomplish my goal to become a web developer. I am a diligent worker who has started from entry level positions and earned his way to Supervisor and Manager positions.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Due to this I have learned to never stop expanding my knowledge and adapt to any circumstance thrown my way. So that I can over come any challenge or obstacle placed in front of me. I am currently employed at a Distribution Center, where I currently hold the position of Warehouse, Inventory and Dispatch Supervisor. After my shift has ended, I spend as much time as I can watching tutorial videos on html, css and I am currently working on Javascript. I relly enjoy learning the process it takes to become a developer and will continue to learn and improve my knowledge to become a web developer.

        I am currently learning the front end aspect of a web developer, which are html, css and Javascript. The current projects I am constantly working on and tinkering with are this Resume Website and several other websites. I have built all the websites from the ground up and am learning new information everday to make these websites the best they can be. So they can show my skills as an junior web developer who is working to improve his skills and knowledge. <br>
